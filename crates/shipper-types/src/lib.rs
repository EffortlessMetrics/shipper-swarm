//! # Types
//!
//! Core domain types for Shipper, including specs, plans, options, receipts, and errors.
//!
//! This module defines the fundamental data structures used throughout Shipper:
//! - [`ReleaseSpec`] - Input specification for a publish operation
//! - [`ReleasePlan`] - Deterministic, SHA256-identified publish plan  
//! - [`RuntimeOptions`] - All runtime configuration options
//! - [`Receipt`] - Audit receipt with evidence for each published crate
//! - [`PreflightReport`] - Preflight assessment with finishability verdict
//! - [`PublishPolicy`] - Policy presets for safety vs. speed tradeoffs
//!
//! ## Serialization
//!
//! Most types implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` from `serde` for
//! persistence to disk. Durations are serialized as milliseconds for
//! cross-platform compatibility.
//!
//! ## Stability
//!
//! These types are considered stable unless otherwise noted. Breaking
//! changes will be documented in the changelog.

///   the registry before and after the next `cargo publish`.
/// - [`ErrorClass::Ambiguous`] is the dangerous case. Cargo's publish flow
///   uploads to the registry first and polls the index afterwards; the poll
///   can time out without affecting the upload. So a non-zero cargo exit
///   can coexist with a successful upload. Ambiguous outcomes MUST be
///   reconciled against registry truth before any further action ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â never
///   blind-retry. See [`ReconciliationOutcome`] and the reconciliation flow
///   in `shipper::engine::parallel::reconcile`.
