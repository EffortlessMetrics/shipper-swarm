//! # shipper-core
//!
//! A reliability layer around `cargo publish` for Rust workspaces — library only.
//!
//! `shipper-core` provides deterministic, resumable crate publishing with
//! comprehensive safety checks and evidence collection. It makes `cargo publish`
//! safe to start and safe to re-run for multi-crate workspaces.
//!
//! This crate contains **no CLI code**. The `shipper` CLI lives in the
//! [`shipper-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/shipper-cli) crate, and the
//! installable binary is published as
//! [`shipper`](https://crates.io/crates/shipper) — which is what users
//! should `cargo install`.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Deterministic ordering** — Crates publish in a reproducible order based on the
//!   dependency graph, ensuring dependencies are always published before dependents.
//! - **Preflight verification** — Catch issues before publishing: git cleanliness,
//!   registry reachability, dry-run compilation, version existence, and ownership checks.
//! - **Readiness verification** — Confirm crates are visible on the registry after
//!   publishing, with configurable polling and backoff strategies.
//! - **Resumable execution** — Interrupted publishes can be resumed from where they
//!   left off, with state persisted to disk.
//! - **Evidence capture** — Receipts and event logs provide audit trails for every
//!   publish operation, including attempt counts, durations, and error classifications.
//! - **Parallel publishing** — Independent crates can be published concurrently for
//!   faster workspace releases (opt-in via [`types::ParallelConfig`]).
//! - **Multiple authentication methods** — Supports token-based authentication and
//!   GitHub Trusted Publishing.
//!
//! ## Pipeline
//!
//! The core flow is **plan → preflight → publish → (resume if interrupted)**:
//!
//! 1. [`plan::build_plan`] reads the workspace via `cargo_metadata`, filters
//!    publishable crates, and topologically sorts them.
//! 2. [`engine::run_preflight`] validates git cleanliness, registry
//!    reachability, dry-run, version existence, and optional ownership.
//! 3. [`engine::run_publish`] executes the plan with retry/backoff,
//!    verifying registry visibility after each crate.
//! 4. [`engine::run_resume`] reloads persisted state and continues from
//!    the first pending or failed package.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//! use shipper_core::{plan, engine, types};
//!
//! // Build a publish plan from the workspace
//! let spec = types::ReleaseSpec {
//!     manifest_path: PathBuf::from("Cargo.toml"),
//!     registry: types::Registry::crates_io(),
//!     selected_packages: None,
//! };
//! let workspace = plan::build_plan(&spec)?;
//!
//! // Configure runtime options (all fields must be provided)
//! let opts = types::RuntimeOptions { /* ... */ };
//! ```
//!
//! ## Key Types
//!
//! - `ReleaseSpec` — Input specification (manifest path, registry, package filter)
//! - `ReleasePlan` — Deterministic, SHA256-identified publish plan
//! - `RuntimeOptions` — All runtime knobs (retry, readiness, policy, etc.)
//! - `Receipt` — Audit receipt with evidence for each published crate
//! - `PreflightReport` — Preflight assessment with finishability verdict
//! - `PublishPolicy` — Policy presets for safety vs. speed tradeoffs
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`plan`] — Workspace analysis and topological plan generation
//! - [`engine`] — Core publish, preflight, and resume logic
//! - [`engine::parallel`] — Wave-based parallel publishing engine
//! - [`types`] — Domain types: specs, plans, options, receipts, errors
//! - [`config`] — Configuration file (`.shipper.toml`) loading and merging
//! - [`auth`] — Token resolution and authentication detection
//! - [`registry`] — Registry API and sparse-index client
//! - [`state`] — Layer 3 persistence: state, events, receipts
//! - [`git`] — Git operations (cleanliness check, context capture)
//! - [`lock`] — Distributed lock to prevent concurrent publishes
//! - [`store`] — `StateStore` trait for pluggable persistence backends
//! - [`cargo`] — Workspace metadata via `cargo_metadata`
//! - [`cargo_failure`] — Cargo publish failure classification heuristics
//! - [`webhook`] — Webhook notifications for publish events
//!
//! ## Stability
//!
//! The library API is subject to change before v1.0.0. Breaking changes will be
//! documented in the [changelog](https://github.com/effortlessmetrics/shipper/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
//!
//! ## CLI Usage
//!
//! For command-line usage, `cargo install shipper --locked` or see the
//! [`shipper-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/shipper-cli) crate if you
//! need to embed the CLI frontend programmatically.
