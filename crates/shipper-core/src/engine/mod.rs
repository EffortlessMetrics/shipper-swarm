/// # Arguments

/// registry, verify each is visible on that registry, and emit a
/// `RehearsalComplete` event summarizing the outcome.
///
/// **Contract**:
/// - Reads `opts.rehearsal_registry` (set via `--rehearsal-registry` or
///   `[rehearsal]` config). Must resolve to a [`Registry`] entry in
///   `opts.registries`; bails clean otherwise.
/// - Refuses to rehearse against the live target (`ws.plan.registry`).
///   Rehearsal and live must be different registries.
/// - Runs sequentially (no parallel yet); stops at the first failure.
/// - Does NOT touch `state.json`. Rehearsal is a pre-publish proof, not
///   an execution; it only appends to `events.jsonl` so auditors can
///   replay the rehearsal from the event log.
/// - Post-publish visibility check uses the SAME readiness mechanism as
///   live publish (`reg.version_exists`). A rehearsal artifact that's
///   not visible within the readiness window fails the rehearsal.
///
/// **Not in this PR**:
/// - Hard gate wiring into `run_publish` (PR 3).
/// - Install/smoke check against the rehearsal registry (PR 3 or 4).
/// - Parallel rehearsal (not planned; rehearsal is infrequent and
