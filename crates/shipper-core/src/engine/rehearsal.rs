/// Enforce the rehearsal hard gate (#97 PR 3).
///
/// Rules, evaluated in order:
///
/// 1. **Rehearsal not configured** (`opts.rehearsal_registry` is `None`) →
///    gate is dormant; publish proceeds. Rehearsal is opt-in; existing
///    workflows that never set a rehearsal registry are unaffected.
///
/// 2. **Operator override** (`opts.rehearsal_skip` is `true`) → publish
///    proceeds with a loud warning logged to the reporter. Use sparingly
///    (incident response, bootstrap runs). The skip decision is
///    operator-visible in stderr; it does *not* synthesize a passing
///    rehearsal receipt, so the audit trail still shows "no rehearsal
///    ran."
///
/// 3. **No rehearsal receipt** (`rehearsal.json` is missing) → refuse.
///    The operator needs to run `shipper rehearse` first.
///
/// 4. **Stale receipt** (receipt exists but `plan_id` mismatches the
///    current workspace's plan) → refuse. A workspace change between
///    rehearse and publish invalidates the rehearsal.
///
/// 5. **Failing receipt** (`passed: false`) → refuse.
///
/// 6. **Fresh passing receipt for current plan** → publish proceeds.
