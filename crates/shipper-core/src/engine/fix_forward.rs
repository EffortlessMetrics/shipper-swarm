//! Fix-forward: supersession plan from a compromised receipt (#98 PR 3).
//!
//! When a published release turns out to be compromised (CVE, leaked
//! secret, broken artifact), the remediation options are:
//!
//! 1. **Yank** — containment. Prevents NEW resolves but leaves
//!    existing lockfiles unchanged. Covered by `shipper yank` (PR 1)
//!    and `shipper plan-yank` (PR 2).
//! 2. **Fix-forward** — ship a successor release that replaces the
//!    compromised one. Downstream consumers pick it up on
//!    `cargo update`. **This module plans that.**
//!
//! The two strategies are complementary: an operator typically runs
//! the yank plan *alongside* a fix-forward so new resolves steer away
//! from the bad chain AND existing consumers have something cleaner to
//! upgrade to.
//!
//! ## What this module does
//!
//! - Read a receipt, find the compromised packages (those with
//!   `compromised_at.is_some()`)
//! - Compute a minimal **supersession plan**: each compromised package
//!   needs its successor version to be published, in the same
//!   topological order as the original plan (dependencies first)
//! - Present the plan as either a human-readable step list or JSON
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT do (yet)
//!
//! - **Edit Cargo.toml files** to bump versions. That's workspace-edit
//!   territory — invasive enough to deserve its own PR with dry-run /
//!   --apply / git-guard semantics.
//! - **Run the bumped publish**. Once the operator has bumped versions
//!   and committed them, `shipper publish` handles the actual train
//!   exactly as for any release. Fix-forward's job is the planning
//!   layer, not the execution.
//! - **Chain successor → receipt** via the `superseded_by` field.
//!   Wiring that requires post-publish receipt amendment from the
//!   successor run; another follow-on.
//!
//! Keeping the first PR to *planning only* matches the scope pattern
//! of `plan-yank` (PR 2) — give operators a text blueprint, let them
//! apply it, leave execution orchestration for a later pass once the
//! shape is validated in the field.
