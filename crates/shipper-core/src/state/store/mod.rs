//! State store abstraction for persistence.
//!
//! Absorbed from the former `shipper-store` microcrate (Phase 2 decrating).
//! This module provides a trait-based abstraction for state storage,
//! allowing for future implementations like S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage.
//!
//! # Layer
//!
//! Layer 3 (`state`). Depends on `ops` (filesystem via `crate::state` helpers),
//! `events`, and `types`. Must not depend on `engine` or `plan`.
