//! The `shipper-cli` binary — thin wrapper over [`shipper_cli::run`].
//!
//! `shipper-cli` is a real CLI adapter (not a shim). Operators should
//! prefer the `shipper` facade package. It installs a binary named
//! `shipper` that forwards to this same [`run`]. This binary exists for
//! two reasons:
//!
//! 1. Backward compatibility for anyone with `cargo install shipper-cli`
//!    wired into their pipelines on the old name.
//! 2. Local workspace development: `cargo run -p shipper-cli -- <args>`
//!    is still a reasonable way to exercise the CLI without installing.
