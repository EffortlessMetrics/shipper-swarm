//! # shipper-cli
//!
//! Real CLI adapter for Shipper (#95 three-crate split).
//!
//! This crate owns the command-line surface: argument parsing
//! (`clap`), subcommand dispatch, help text, progress rendering. It
//! depends on [`shipper_core`] for the actual engine.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! shipper (install façade) -> shipper-cli (this crate) -> shipper-core (engine)
//! ```
//!
//! The `shipper` binary on crates.io is a three-line wrapper that
//! calls [`run`]. This crate also ships its own `shipper-cli` binary,
//! another three-line wrapper over [`run`], for callers that want the
//! adapter crate installed directly (`cargo install shipper-cli`) or
//! for workspace-local development.
//!
//! ## Embedding
//!
//! Most callers should use the `shipper` CLI directly. If you need to
//! embed the exact CLI surface in another Rust program — for example,
//! a wrapper that invokes `shipper` with extra preflight steps — call
//! [`run`]. For programmatic use without a `clap` dependency, depend
//! on [`shipper_core`](https://crates.io/crates/shipper-core) instead.

#[derive(Subcommand, Debug)]
enum Commands {
    /// Print the deterministic publish plan (dependency-first ordering).
    #[command(long_about = "\
Print the deterministic publish plan (dependency-first ordering).

Reads the workspace via `cargo metadata`, filters publishable crates,
topologically sorts them, and prints the order in which they will be
published. The plan is deterministic — the same workspace produces the
same plan ID on any machine — which is the anchor that makes `resume`
safe.

EXAMPLES:
    # Preview the publish order for every publishable workspace member:
    shipper plan

    # Plan with dependency-level breakdown (who can publish in parallel):
    shipper plan --verbose
")]
    Plan,
    /// Run preflight checks without publishing.
    #[command(long_about = "\
Run preflight checks without publishing.

Validates everything that can fail a live publish — git cleanliness,
registry reachability, token availability, dry-run, ownership — and
prints a `Finishability` verdict (PROVEN / NOT PROVEN / FAILED). No
crate is uploaded. Run this before `publish` on any run you cannot
afford to restart from scratch.

EXAMPLES:
    # Run preflight across the whole workspace:
    shipper preflight

    # Machine-readable output for CI gates:
    shipper preflight --format json
")]
    Preflight {
        /// Run preflight as a standalone audit.
        ///
        /// Writes events to a session-scoped
        /// `preflight-only-<session>.events.jsonl` sidecar under `state_dir`,
        /// does not append to the authoritative `events.jsonl`, and never
        /// writes publish state (`state.json`). Use this when you want a fresh
        /// Proven/NotProven/Failed signal without mutating resumable publish
        /// state. Part of

        preflight_only: bool,
    },
    /// Execute the plan (will resume if a matching state file exists).
    #[command(long_about = "\
Execute the publish plan end-to-end, persisting resumable state after
every step.

If `.shipper/state.json` already exists for this plan, `publish` picks
up where the previous run left off — already-published crates are
skipped, and the run continues from the first pending or failed
package. On interruption (Ctrl-C, network drop, ambiguous registry
response), rerun `shipper publish` or `shipper resume`.

EXAMPLES:
    # Publish the whole workspace to crates.io:
    shipper publish

    # Publish a subset, allowing a dirty git tree (local rehearsal):
    shipper publish --package shipper-core --allow-dirty
")]
    Publish,
    /// Resume a previous publish run.
    #[command(long_about = "\
Resume a previous publish run.

Loads `.shipper/state.json`, validates it against the current plan, skips
already-published packages, and continues from the first pending or failed
package. Use this after a killed runner, network interruption, or manual
stop.

EXAMPLES:
    # Continue the current workspace release from persisted state:
    shipper resume

    # Resume from a specific crate after reviewing the saved state:
    shipper resume --resume-from shipper-core

    # Force resume when the computed plan differs from saved state:
    shipper resume --force-resume
")]
    Resume,
    /// Rehearse a release against an alternate registry.
    ///
    /// Publishes every crate in the plan to the registry named by
    /// `--rehearsal-registry` (or `[rehearsal] registry = "..."` in
    /// `.shipper.toml`), verifies visibility on that registry, and
    /// emits a `RehearsalComplete { passed, ... }` event to
    /// `events.jsonl` so the outcome is auditable.
    ///
    /// Rehearse must target a non-live registry (kellnr, a sandbox
    /// crates.io account, or a throwaway alternate registry). Shipper
    /// refuses to rehearse against the same registry as the live target.
    ///
    /// When a rehearsal registry is configured, live publish later enforces
    /// the recorded `rehearsal.json` gate unless `--skip-rehearsal` is used.
    Rehearse,
    /// Compare local workspace versions to the registry.
    #[command(long_about = "\
Compare local workspace versions to the registry.

Use status before publish or after an interruption to see which local crate
versions already exist on the target registry. This is a read-only registry
comparison and does not mutate `.shipper/` state.

EXAMPLES:
    # Check every publishable workspace member:
    shipper status

    # Check one package against the configured registry:
    shipper status --package shipper-core

    # Watch persisted release progress while publish or resume is running:
    shipper status --watch
")]
    Status {
        /// Watch local `.shipper/` state and events until interrupted.
        ///
        /// Watch mode is read-only and does not poll the registry. It summarizes
        /// `state.json` and `events.jsonl` so operators can see current progress,
        /// the last durable event, and the next scheduled wait/retry/poll.
        #[arg(long)]
        watch: bool,
    },
    /// Print environment and auth diagnostics.
    #[command(long_about = "\
Print environment and auth diagnostics.

Checks local tools, registry reachability, authentication signals, workspace
health, and state-directory basics. Run this first when preflight or publish
reports an environment blocker.

EXAMPLES:
    # Inspect local release prerequisites:
    shipper doctor

    # Check a named Cargo registry:
    shipper doctor --registry crates-io
")]
    Doctor,
    /// View detailed event log.
    #[command(long_about = "\
View the authoritative event log.

Reads `<state-dir>/events.jsonl`, which is the truth source for publish and
resume state transitions. Use `--follow` while another terminal is running
publish or resume.

EXAMPLES:
    # Print the current event log:
    shipper inspect-events

    # Follow appended events during a release:
    shipper inspect-events --follow

    /// View detailed receipt with evidence.
    #[command(long_about = "\
View the end-of-run receipt with evidence.

Reads `<state-dir>/receipt.json` and prints the completed release summary,
package outcomes, git context, environment fingerprint, and captured evidence.

EXAMPLES:

    shipper inspect-receipt

    # Emit the receipt in JSON for CI or an internal developer portal:

Generate or execute a receipt-driven remediation plan.

In `--dry-run` mode, reads a prior `receipt.json`, targets a specific bad
crate version, computes the affected reverse-topological yank order and
publish-directional fix-forward suggestions, then writes
`<state-dir>/remediation-plan.json` for operator review and agent consumption.

In `--execute-plan` mode, consumes that reviewed artifact and executes only the
recorded containment yanks. It does NOT edit manifests or publish fix-forward
successors.
