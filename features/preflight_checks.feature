Feature: Preflight verification
  Shipper runs preflight checks before publishing to ensure the publish will
  succeed and the user has appropriate permissions.

  Background:
    Given a workspace with crates "core" and "app" where "app" depends on "core"

  Scenario: Preflight passes for new crates with token
    Given a valid registry token is configured
    And the registry returns "not found" for all crates
    When I run "shipper preflight"
    Then the exit code is 0
    And the preflight report shows finishability "Proven"
    And all packages are marked as new crates

  Scenario: Preflight uses policy from .shipper.toml
    Given a workspace with crates "core" and "app" where "app" depends on "core"
    And a file named ".shipper.toml" with policy set to "fast"
    When I run "shipper preflight" without passing --policy
    Then the exit code is 0
    And the preflight report shows token not detected

  Scenario: Preflight detects already published versions
    Given a valid registry token is configured
    And the registry returns "published" for "core@0.1.0"
    And the registry returns "not found" for "app@0.1.0"
    When I run "shipper preflight"
    Then the preflight report shows "core@0.1.0" as already published
    And the preflight report shows "app@0.1.0" as not published

  Scenario: Preflight warns on missing token
    Given no registry token is configured
    And the registry returns "not found" for all crates
    When I run "shipper preflight" with "--policy fast"
    Then the preflight report shows token not detected
    And the exit code is 0

  Scenario: Preflight fails with dirty git tree
    Given a valid registry token is configured
    And the git working tree has uncommitted changes
    When I run "shipper preflight" without "--allow-dirty"
    Then the exit code is non-zero
    And the error message contains "dirty"

  Scenario: Strict ownership check fails without token
    Given no registry token is configured
    And the registry returns "not found" for all crates
    When I run "shipper preflight" with "--strict-ownership"
    Then the exit code is non-zero
    And the error message mentions token or ownership

  Scenario: Balanced policy ignores strict ownership requirement
    Given no registry token is configured
    And the registry returns "not found" for all crates
    When I run "shipper preflight" with "--policy balanced --strict-ownership --no-verify"
    Then the exit code is 0
    And the preflight report shows token not detected

  Scenario: Preflight passes with allow-dirty on dirty working tree
    Given a valid registry token is configured
    And the git working tree has uncommitted changes
    And the registry returns "not found" for all crates
    When I run "shipper preflight" with "--allow-dirty"
    Then the exit code is 0

  Scenario: Preflight reports finishability as Unproven without token
    Given no registry token is configured
    And the registry returns "not found" for all crates
    When I run "shipper preflight" with "--policy fast"
    Then the preflight report shows finishability "Unproven"

  Scenario: Preflight skips ownership check when flag is set
    Given a valid registry token is configured
    And the registry returns "not found" for all crates
    When I run "shipper preflight" with "--skip-ownership-check"
    Then the exit code is 0
    And ownership verification is not performed

  Scenario: Preflight validates all crates in dependency order
    Given a valid registry token is configured
    And the registry returns "not found" for all crates
    When I run "shipper preflight"
    Then "core" is checked before "app" in the preflight report
