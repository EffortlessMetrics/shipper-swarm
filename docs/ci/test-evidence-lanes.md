# Test Evidence Lanes

This document maps the test evidence strategy for `shipper`: which lanes run when, what each lane proves, and how they compose into a complete evidence picture.

## Doctrine

```
PRs:     routed Rust-small required gate + ripr (advisory) + targeted mutation when risk warrants it
Main:    broad full-CI evidence after merge
Weekly:  deeper fuzz / proptest / mutation lanes
Release: publish / readiness / security proof must be clean to ship
```

`ripr` is the PR-time exposure filter: static mutation-exposure analysis that asks whether changed behavior appears exposed to a meaningful test oracle. It does not run mutants. Full mutation testing is the runtime backstop and belongs in label-gated PRs, weekly schedule, and release lanes — never the default PR hot path.

## Workflow Inventory

Every workflow under `.github/workflows/` and the lane each one occupies. Keep
this inventory aligned when workflows are added, removed, or retargeted.

| Workflow | Trigger | Lane | Required for merge? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `architecture-guard.yml` | `push` + `pull_request` | Every PR | Advisory in swarm branch protection |
| `em-ci-routed-rust.yml` | `push` + `pull_request` + `merge_group` + `workflow_dispatch` | Required PR gate | Required via `Shipper Rust Small Result` |
| `ci.yml` | `push` + `workflow_dispatch` + weekly `schedule` | Main/manual full-CI evidence + weekly heavy proptest | Required when triggered; not the default PR gate |
| `coverage.yml` | `push` (main) + `pull_request` + `workflow_dispatch` | Advisory / labeled | Advisory |
| `droid-review.yml` | `pull_request` | Advisory (same-repo + bot guard) | Advisory |
| `droid.yml` | `issues` + `pull_request` (command-triggered) | Advisory (trusted-actor guard) | Advisory |
| `droid-security-scan.yml` | `schedule` + `workflow_dispatch` | Scheduled (Mon 08:00 UTC) | Advisory |
| `fuzz.yml` | `schedule` + `workflow_dispatch` | Nightly | Advisory |
| `live-runner-interruption-rehearsal.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` + path-scoped `pull_request` | Safe runner-artifact interruption/resume proof | Advisory/manual; required when triggered |
| `mutation.yml` | `schedule` + `workflow_dispatch` + `pull_request` (label-gated) | Weekly + label-gated PR | Advisory |
| `release.yml` | `push` (tags `v*.*.*`) + `workflow_dispatch` | Tag-triggered | Required (when triggered) |
| `ripr.yml` | `pull_request` + `workflow_dispatch` | Advisory (`continue-on-error: true`) | Advisory |

## Required PR Gate

`em-ci-routed-rust.yml` is the required PR workflow. Branch protection requires
only the normalized `Shipper Rust Small Result` check.

In `EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm`, trusted same-repo PRs route through
self-hosted runners in this order:

```text
CPX42 -> CX43 -> CX53
```

Fallback paths use the tiny self-hosted fallback lane. Silent GitHub-hosted
fallback is blocked: `shipper-swarm` workflow jobs run on self-hosted capacity,
including the fallback route, unless a future policy PR explicitly restores a
GitHub-hosted emergency path.

Public fork PRs are denied by the normalized result instead of running
repository code on self-hosted runners. A maintainer can move trusted work onto
a same-repo branch when it needs the swarm gate.

Do not infer release-authority behavior from this swarm routing policy.
`EffortlessMetrics/shipper` remains the release authority, and the broad
`shipper-swarm` self-hosted sweep must not be synced there until release
runner, binary-build, and credential boundaries are explicitly decided.

The self-hosted Rust-small lane proves:

```bash
cargo check --workspace --locked --all-targets
cargo nextest run --workspace --locked --all-targets --all-features --profile ci
cargo test --workspace --locked --doc
cargo run -p shipper -- --help
cargo run -p shipper -- plan --help
cargo run -p shipper -- preflight --help
```

The tiny fallback intentionally proves less:

```bash
cargo check --workspace --locked --all-targets
cargo run -p shipper -- --help
cargo run -p shipper -- plan --help
```

## `ci.yml` — Full-CI Lane Map

`ci.yml` is the broad full-CI workflow. It no longer runs on every PR. It runs
on pushes to `main`, manual `workflow_dispatch`, and the weekly schedule. Every
entry below is required when `ci.yml` is triggered unless the `Predicate`
column carries a gate.

| Job | Predicate | Wall clock | What it proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lint` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` | ~1 min | `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`. |
| `policy` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` | ~1 min | All seven xtask policy checks in `--mode blocking-allowlist`, plus `policy-report`. See `docs/policy/NON_RUST_ROLLOUT.md`. |
| `test` (nextest) | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` | ~17 min | Unit and integration tests pass on the self-hosted runner pool. Doc-tests run alongside. |
| `crypto-proptests-heavy` | `schedule` / `push` / `workflow_dispatch` only | ~20 min | Full-strength `proptest` for `shipper-encrypt` round-trips. **Not** on PR — too slow. |
| `msrv` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` | ~1 min | `cargo check --workspace` on the declared MSRV (1.95). |
| `security` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` | ~1 min | `cargo audit` against the current advisory database. |
| `docs` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` | ~1 min | `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` clean under `-D warnings` (catches `rustdoc::invalid-html-tags` and friends). |
| `bdd` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` | ~3 min | Publish and resume BDD scenarios plus the synthetic interruption-resume rehearsal (`e2e_rehearse`) that proves persisted state/events let `shipper resume` complete without duplicate publishes. |
| `fuzz-smoke` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` | ~10 min | Five fuzz targets at low energy: load state, resolve token, schema version, release levels, and output redaction. |
| `cross-platform` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` / `schedule` | ~2 min | Native Linux target check for x86_64 on self-hosted runners. aarch64 requires a cross C toolchain in the runner image and is not part of the current default swarm CI proof. Windows/macOS release assets stay a release-authority concern. |
| `release-build` | `push` / `workflow_dispatch` only | ~2 min | Release-profile build (LTO + strip) remains available on main and manual runs; tag-time binaries are built by `release.yml`. |

Broad full-CI remains part of the evidence story, but it is not the merge gate
for ordinary PRs. The required PR signal is the routed result above.

## Manual Full-CI Proof for a PR

Most PRs should merge on `Shipper Rust Small Result` plus focused local or
review evidence. Use extra full-CI proof when a PR touches release-critical
behavior, runner policy, workflow routing, broad state/event/receipt contracts,
or another surface where post-merge discovery would be too expensive.

For same-repo branches, run the full lane before merge with:

```text
Actions -> CI -> Run workflow -> branch: <pr-branch>
```

That manual dispatch runs `ci.yml` on the selected branch. It exercises the
broad self-hosted evidence set, including nextest, doc tests, policy, BDD,
fuzz smoke, heavy crypto proptests, native Linux target check, and release
build. It does not publish crates or move release authority into
`shipper-swarm`.

For PR-time advisory evidence, a maintainer can also apply labels:

| Label | Effect |
|---|---|
| `coverage` | Runs `coverage.yml` on the PR. |
| `mutation` | Runs the label-gated `mutants-pr` job on changed production Rust files. |
| `full-ci` | Runs both PR coverage and label-gated mutation. It does not trigger `ci.yml`; use manual workflow dispatch for the broad full-CI lane. |

Do not run same-repo self-hosted full-CI proof on untrusted fork code. Move the
work onto a trusted same-repo branch first, or rely on the fork-safe normalized
result behavior until a maintainer has reviewed the code.

When manual full-CI proof is used as merge evidence, record the workflow run ID
in the PR so future queue stewards can audit what was proven.

## Policy Gates (xtask-Enforced, Inside `ci.yml`'s `policy` Job)

The `policy` job runs each check in blocking-allowlist mode and uploads `target/policy/` as an artifact regardless of outcome.

| Check | What it proves | Introduced |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo xtask check-file-policy --mode blocking-allowlist` | All tracked non-Rust files are receipted in `policy/non-rust-allowlist.toml`. | #210 |
| `cargo xtask check-generated` | Receipts for `policy/no-panic-baseline.json` and `badges/*.json` are present and valid. | #209 / #182 PR 2 |
| `cargo xtask check-executable-files` | Tracked executable files match `policy/executable-allowlist.toml`. | #209 |
| `cargo xtask check-dependency-surfaces` | Cargo manifests match `policy/dependency-surface-allowlist.toml`. | #209 |
| `cargo xtask check-workflow-surfaces` | `.github/workflows/*.yml` files match `policy/workflow-allowlist.toml`. | #210 |
| `cargo xtask check-process-policy` | Workflow `run:` commands stay inside their declared process profile. | #211 |
| `cargo xtask check-network-policy` | Workflow endpoints stay inside their declared network profile. | #211 |
| `cargo xtask check-lint-policy` | MSRV agrees across `Cargo.toml`, `clippy.toml`, `policy/clippy-lints.toml`; every `[workspace.lints.clippy]` entry has a ledger entry. | #179 / #191 |
| `cargo xtask no-panic check --mode blocking` | No new panic-family debt since `policy/no-panic-baseline.json`. Runs in `release.yml` policy-gate today (see Release Proof). | #187 |

## Advisory / Routed (PRs only)

| Job | Workflow | Trigger | What it proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coverage` | `coverage.yml` | `push` to main, dispatch, `coverage` or `full-ci` label on PR | Codecov line/branch coverage. |
| `rust-small` | `em-ci-routed-rust.yml` | PRs, merge groups, pushes to main, dispatch | Required Rust-small PR gate with self-hosted routing and explicit fallback control. |
| `ripr-pilot` | `ripr.yml` | PRs touching `crates/**`, `xtask/**`, `Cargo.{toml,lock}`, `ripr.toml`, `policy/ripr-suppressions.toml`, `.github/workflows/ripr.yml`. `continue-on-error: true`. | Static mutation-exposure analysis: does the diff appear exposed to a meaningful test oracle? |
| `mutants-pr` | `mutation.yml` | PRs labeled `mutation` or `full-ci` | Runtime mutation backstop scoped to the PR's changed files via `cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed`. Blocking when it runs. |
| `droid-review` | `droid-review.yml` | Same-repo PRs (incl. `dependabot[bot]`). | Automated code review via Factory Droid (BYOK MiniMax M2.7). Advisory comments, no merge gate. |
| `droid` | `droid.yml` | `@droid` mentions on issues / PRs by `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`. | On-demand Droid actions: review, refactor, explain. |

## Scheduled

| Job | Schedule | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| `fuzz` matrix (6 targets) | `fuzz.yml` — daily | Extended fuzz energy beyond the PR smoke pass. |
| `crypto-proptests-heavy` | `ci.yml` — on `push`/`schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` | Full-strength `proptest` for `shipper-encrypt`. |
| `mutants-weekly` | `mutation.yml` — Sunday 04:00 UTC | Mutation score across `shipper-duration` / `shipper-types` / `shipper-config`. Expanding to full trust-critical surface is a future rollout step (60-minute budget today). |
| `droid-security-scan` | `droid-security-scan.yml` — Monday 08:00 UTC | Factory Droid security scan, 7-day window, medium threshold, critical blocking. |

## Targeted Mutation on a PR (Label-Gated)

When a maintainer applies the `mutation` or `full-ci` label, `mutation.yml`'s `mutants-pr` job runs:

```bash
cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed --base origin/<PR-base>
```

The wrapper computes `git diff <base>...HEAD --name-only -- '*.rs'`, filters out `tests/` and `benches/` paths (cargo-mutants only mutates production source), and runs `cargo mutants --no-shuffle --file <each>`. A `--dry-run` mode (`cargo mutants --list`) is available locally for shape inspection without running tests.

Local invocation:

```bash
# Inspect which mutants the PR would generate, no tests run.
cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed --dry-run

# Real run.
cargo xtask mutants-pr --changed
```

If `cargo-mutants` is missing locally, the wrapper prints install instructions and exits advisory-success rather than erroring; CI installs the tool before invoking.

A maintainer should apply the label when:

- Changes touch `shipper-core` publish/reconcile/readiness, `shipper-encrypt`, `shipper-output-sanitizer`, `shipper-cargo-failure`, `shipper-sparse-index`, `shipper-webhook`, or state/event/receipt types.
- `ripr` raises a `warning`-level finding in a trust-critical crate that benefits from execution-backed confirmation.

## Release Proof

`release.yml` proves end-to-end publication safety. Triggers on `v*.*.*` tag push or `workflow_dispatch`.

| Job (release.yml) | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `build-binaries` | Linux/Windows/macOS release binaries produced (one matrix leg per target). |
| `msrv-gate` | `cargo check --workspace` on declared MSRV. |
| `policy-gate` | `cargo xtask no-panic check --mode blocking` + `cargo xtask check-lint-policy`. Blocks publish if either ledger has drifted since the SHA the baseline was generated at. (#187) |
| `publish-crates-io` | Dogfoods Shipper itself: `shipper plan` → `shipper preflight` → `shipper publish`. Trusted Publishing via OIDC; falls back to `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`. Idempotent — resumes from `.shipper/state.json` on rerun. |
| `create-release` | Attaches platform binaries and `.shipper/` state to the GitHub Release. Runs only after `publish-crates-io` succeeds. |
| `release-rehearse` | `workflow_dispatch mode=rehearse`: plan + preflight dry-run only. Useful before cutting a tag. |
| `release-resume` | `workflow_dispatch mode=resume`: re-enters the publish train from a prior run's `shipper-state-final` artifact. Plan-ID match required. |

The live recover rehearsal remains a manual release-candidate procedure because
it intentionally publishes throwaway crates.io versions and then yanks them.
The full-CI proof is the synthetic side: `ci.yml` runs
`cargo test -p shipper-cli --test e2e_rehearse -- --nocapture`, which exercises
a real `shipper publish` interruption/resume sequence against fake Cargo and a
mock registry, then checks `state.json`, append-only `events.jsonl`, skipped
published crates, and duplicate-publish invariants.

## Evidence Composition

A complete evidence picture for a release requires all of the following:

| Evidence | Source |
|---|---|
| Required PR gate | `em-ci-routed-rust.yml` `Shipper Rust Small Result` |
| Workspace tests pass | `ci.yml` `test` lane on the self-hosted runner pool for main/manual/weekly runs |
| Native Linux target check compiles | `ci.yml` `cross-platform` lane for x86_64 Linux on main/manual/weekly runs |
| No known vulnerabilities | `ci.yml` `security` (`cargo audit`) on main/manual/weekly runs |
| No architectural drift | `architecture-guard.yml` |
| Format clean | `ci.yml` `lint` on main/manual/weekly runs |
| Clippy clean | `ci.yml` `lint` (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`) on main/manual/weekly runs |
| MSRV verified | `ci.yml` `msrv` + `release.yml` `msrv-gate` |
| BDD scenarios pass | `ci.yml` `bdd` on main/manual/weekly runs |
| No panic-family debt added | `release.yml` `policy-gate` (`no-panic check --mode blocking`) |
| Policy gates green | `ci.yml` `policy` (every xtask check in blocking-allowlist) |
| Static exposure signal | `ripr.yml` `ripr-pilot` (advisory) |
| Mutation signal (opt-in) | `mutation.yml` `mutants-pr` (label-gated) or `mutants-weekly` |
| Coverage signal (opt-in) | `coverage.yml` (label-triggered) |
| Publish path verified | `release.yml` `publish-crates-io` (dogfoods Shipper) |
| Trusted Publishing configured | OIDC token exchange in `release.yml` |

## Trust-Critical Crates

These crates receive the most rigorous mutation coverage because they handle real registry, state, and security operations:

| Crate | Risk |
|---|---|
| `shipper-core` | Publish engine, reconcile, resume, plan |
| `shipper-types` | Shared state/event types |
| `shipper-encrypt` | Token encryption |
| `shipper-output-sanitizer` | Token redaction in logs |
| `shipper-cargo-failure` | Cargo exit-code / stderr classification |
| `shipper-sparse-index` | Registry sparse-index parsing |
| `shipper-registry` | Registry API interactions |
| `shipper-cli` | CLI dispatch, output |
| `shipper` | Install façade |

## Routing Follow-Ups

The current swarm posture optimizes for a reliable required PR signal first:
`Shipper Rust Small Result`. Broad full-CI still runs after merge on `main`, on
manual dispatch, and on the weekly schedule.

Concrete follow-up candidates:

1. Repeat forced route proof and refresh the proof ledger whenever route order,
   runner labels, fallback policy, or the normalized-result contract changes.
2. Revisit whether `architecture-guard.yml` should remain separately required
   once the routed Rust-small lane is proven stable under the new settings.
