# Tutorial: Recover from an interrupted release safely

This tutorial exercises Shipper's interruption and resume journey with fake
Cargo, a mock registry, and a real cross-job artifact handoff. It is the
default rehearsal because it proves durable recovery mechanics without
creating public registry versions.

> **Do not learn recovery by cancelling a real crates.io publish.** A real
> upload may succeed before the client reports failure, and yanking is
> containment rather than deletion. Destructive real-registry rehearsal is a
> separate release-authority operation.

## What you'll learn

- Which `.shipper/` files are retained across an interruption.
- Why events are authoritative and state is a projection.
- How `status --durable` fails closed on disagreement or uncertain liveness.
- How plan, workspace, registry, and run identity guard resume.
- Why `StillUnknown` never supplies a blind retry command.

## 1. Run the safe rehearsal

Anyone working from this source checkout can run the local fake-Cargo and mock
registry fixture:

```bash
cargo test -p shipper-cli --test e2e_rehearse \
  rehearsal_interrupted_publish_then_resume_preserves_invariants \
  -- --exact --nocapture
```

This proves the local interruption/resume invariants without registry writes.
The remaining steps inspect the cross-job version. They require Actions write
permission on the release-authority repository; users without that permission
can stop after the local fixture or use the
[alternate-registry rehearsal](../how-to/rehearse-against-an-alt-registry.md).

Maintainers can dispatch the active workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run live-runner-interruption-rehearsal.yml \
  --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper \
  --ref main
```

Record the run ID, then wait for it to finish:

```bash
gh run watch <run-id> --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper
```

The workflow uses one job to create interrupted evidence and a separate job to
download it and resume. It never publishes to crates.io.

## 2. Download both evidence artifacts

```bash
gh run download <run-id> \
  --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper \
  --name shipper-live-interruption-seed-<run-id> \
  --dir seed-evidence

gh run download <run-id> \
  --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper \
  --name shipper-live-interruption-resume-<run-id> \
  --dir resumed-evidence
```

Keep the seed and resumed directories separate. The seed should contain
`events.jsonl`, `state.json`, and the fake-Cargo command log. The completed
resume artifact should additionally contain `receipt.json`.

## 3. Inspect the interrupted evidence

The workflow artifacts contain `.shipper/` evidence, not their matching source
workspace. Inspect them as raw evidence rather than invoking a command that
must recompute the release plan:

```bash
jq -c '.' seed-evidence/events.jsonl | tail -20
jq -r '.plan_id, (.packages[] | "\(.name)@\(.version): \(.state.state)")' \
  seed-evidence/state.json
```

Do not run `status --durable` from an artifact-only directory. It recomputes a
release plan and needs the exact matching workspace and candidate binary.

## 4. Inspect the completed resume

Inspect the completed artifact without combining it with the seed:

```bash
jq -c '.' resumed-evidence/events.jsonl | tail -20
jq '.' resumed-evidence/state.json
jq '.' resumed-evidence/receipt.json
```

Verify that:

- already-published packages were skipped rather than republished;
- the same `plan_id` and workspace/run identity bind both segments;
- `events.jsonl` contains one authoritative publish outcome per package;
- `state.json` agrees as the resumable projection;
- `receipt.json` summarizes the terminal run.

## 5. Apply the rule to a real interruption

After an actual runner cancellation, restore the entire `.shipper/` directory
inside the exact source checkout and use the matching candidate binary. Start
from that workspace root with:

```bash
shipper status --durable
shipper inspect-events
```

Run `shipper resume` only when the durable result and retained evidence say the
run is interrupted and safe to resume. Resume recomputes the current plan and
refuses mismatched plan, source, workspace, registry, or run identity.

The durable result is intentionally fail-closed. `no_evidence` means no durable
run was found; `identity_mismatch` means source, plan, registry, or evidence
identity differs; `evidence_disagreement` means the retained sources
contradict each other; and `unknown` means an unfinished run's liveness cannot
be established. None authorizes resume. On Linux, `Live` requires an exact
local boot, PID namespace, PID, and process-start match. `NotLive` means the
process was absent inside the same proven scope; it is not by itself permission
to resume.

Do not use `--force-resume` as a normal recovery step. It overrides a plan
guard and requires a separate operator risk decision.

## 6. Ambiguity is not interruption

If Cargo's result is ambiguous, Shipper queries registry truth before any new
publish attempt:

- `Published`: retain the reconciliation evidence and advance.
- `NotPublished`: the normal policy may retry.
- `StillUnknown`: stop, retain `reconciliation.json`, and investigate. No
  generated retry command is safe.

Use `shipper inspect-events`, `shipper inspect-receipt` when a receipt exists,
and the paths reported by `status --durable`. Never infer safety from a quiet
log, an old lock timestamp, or exit code alone.
