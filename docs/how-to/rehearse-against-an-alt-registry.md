# How-to: Rehearse a release against an alternate registry

Goal: prove a release will actually publish and resolve cleanly BEFORE
you touch crates.io. This is the Prove pillar's phase-2 check —
`cargo publish --dry-run` validates that Cargo can package the crate,
but it cannot prove that the packaged tarballs will actually install
from a registry index with real workspace-path → registry-path
resolution. That gap is what this guide closes.

## When to use this

- First time publishing a multi-crate workspace (the rc.1 landing mine
  that wasted a tag cycle).
- After any workspace refactor that reshapes dependency edges
  (new intra-workspace deps, path → registry migrations, feature
  reshuffles).
- Before any release you can't afford to retract.

If you've already shipped the workspace once and are just bumping
versions on stable code, rehearsal is overkill. If anything about the
publish shape has changed, rehearse.

## Prerequisites

- An **isolated, non-live registry on a distinct configured authority** whose rehearsal
  artifacts can be discarded without public impact. Options, rough-ordered by
  effort:
  - **kellnr** (recommended for CI): self-host a registry sidecar per
    release. [kellnr docs](https://kellnr.io/documentation). Short-
    lived instance — spin up, rehearse, tear down.
  - **A non-production private registry**: if your organization already has
    one (Cloudsmith, Artifactory, JFrog, or Cargo-hosted), use a dedicated
    non-production instance on an authority distinct from the live target.
    A namespace or account on the same authority is not an isolation boundary.

> **Destructive target fence:** crates.io is not a rehearsal registry. A
> throwaway account or different crate name still creates permanent public
> registry history. Testing against crates.io belongs only to a separately
> authorized release-authority operation, not this default guide.

- Registry URL + token configured in Cargo so `cargo publish --registry`
  works.

- A `.shipper.toml` or CLI flag that names the registry for rehearsal.

## Step 1 — Configure the rehearsal registry

### Via `.shipper.toml`

```toml
[registry]
name = "crates-io"
api_base = "https://crates.io"
index_base = "https://index.crates.io"

[[registries.registries]]
name = "rehearsal"
api_base = "https://rehearsal.internal.example.com"
index_base = "https://rehearsal.internal.example.com/api/v1/crates"

[rehearsal]
enabled = true
registry = "rehearsal"
```

`[[registries.registries]]` teaches Shipper about the registry's URLs.
`[rehearsal]` records which declared entry is the rehearsal target; the command
still selects that entry explicitly.

### Via CLI

```bash
shipper rehearse --registries rehearsal --rehearsal-registry rehearsal
```

The first flag selects the configured catalog entry for this command; the
second activates rehearsal against that selected entry. This does not change
the live `[registry]` target.

## Step 2 — Dry-run in isolation

```bash
shipper rehearse --registries rehearsal --rehearsal-registry rehearsal
```

What this does:

1. Validates that the rehearsal registry is configured, has a different name,
   and has no normalized API/index authority overlap with the live target.
   Every `crates.io` or `.crates.io` host is rejected as a rehearsal target.
   This configured-identity guard does not prove DNS/CNAME, resolved-IP, or
   administrative isolation; independently verify the non-live service.
2. For each crate in the plan (topological order):
   - Runs `cargo publish --registry rehearsal -p <crate>`.
   - Waits for the crate to appear on the rehearsal registry's
     visibility endpoint — same `version_exists` check the live
     path uses, so if the real publish would fail visibility the
     rehearsal fails first.
3. If `--smoke-install <crate>` is set, runs
   `cargo install --registry rehearsal <crate>` after the rehearsal
   publish succeeds. This is opt-in because the target crate must have
   a binary target.
4. Emits per-step events to `<state_dir>/events.jsonl`:
   - `RehearsalStarted { registry, plan_id, package_count }`
   - `RehearsalPackagePublished { name, version, duration_ms }`
     per success
   - `RehearsalSmokeCheckStarted { name, version, registry }` and
     `RehearsalSmokeCheckSucceeded { name, version, duration_ms }`
     when smoke-install is enabled and succeeds
   - `RehearsalPackageFailed { name, version, class, message }`
     per failure (stops the loop)
   - `RehearsalComplete { passed, registry, plan_id, summary }`
5. Writes a sidecar `<state_dir>/rehearsal.json` — the hard gate
   consults this file later.

Exit status is non-zero on rehearsal failure, so CI lanes that wrap
this command fail automatically.

## Step 3 — The hard gate

Once you have a passing rehearsal, the hard gate blocks live publish
without one:

```bash
shipper publish
```

Decision tree:

1. `rehearsal_registry` not configured → dormant, publish proceeds.
   (Rehearsal is opt-in; workflows that haven't adopted it are
   unaffected.)
2. `--skip-rehearsal` flag set → publish proceeds with a loud warning.
   No fake-passing receipt is synthesized; the audit trail shows the
   bypass honestly. Use sparingly (incident response, bootstrap runs).
3. No `rehearsal.json` → refuse. Run
   `shipper rehearse --registries NAME --rehearsal-registry NAME` first.
4. `rehearsal.json`'s `plan_id` differs from the current plan →
   refuse (stale). The workspace changed between rehearse and publish.
5. `passed: false` → refuse, citing the rehearsal summary.
6. Fresh passing receipt for the current plan → proceed, info-log
   "rehearsal gate: passing receipt found (N packages against
   'rehearsal', plan_id ...)".

## Example: GitHub Actions with kellnr sidecar

```yaml
name: Release

  push:
    tags: ['v*.*.*']

jobs:
  rehearse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      kellnr:
        image: ghcr.io/kellnr/kellnr:latest
        ports:
          - 8000:8000
        env:
          KELLNR_ORIGIN__ADDR: http://localhost:8000
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - run: cargo install shipper --locked

      # Point both Cargo and Shipper at the kellnr sidecar while retaining
      # crates.io as the explicit live target.
      - name: Configure rehearsal registry
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.cargo
          cat >> ~/.cargo/config.toml <<EOF
          [registries.rehearsal]
          index = "sparse+http://localhost:8000/api/v1/crates/"
          EOF
          cat >> ~/.cargo/credentials.toml <<EOF
          [registries.rehearsal]
          token = "Bearer ${{ secrets.KELLNR_TOKEN }}"
          EOF
          cat > .shipper.toml <<EOF
          [registry]
          name = "crates-io"
          api_base = "https://crates.io"
          index_base = "https://index.crates.io"

          [[registries.registries]]
          name = "rehearsal"
          api_base = "http://localhost:8000"
          index_base = "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/crates"

          [rehearsal]
          enabled = true
          allow_loopback = true
          registry = "rehearsal"
          EOF

      - name: Rehearse
        env:
          CARGO_REGISTRIES_REHEARSAL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KELLNR_TOKEN }}
        run: shipper rehearse --allow-loopback --registries rehearsal --rehearsal-registry rehearsal

      - name: Upload rehearsal artifacts (always)
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
        with:
          name: shipper-rehearsal
          path: .shipper/
          include-hidden-files: true

  publish:
    needs: rehearse
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v8
        with:
          name: shipper-rehearsal
          path: .shipper/
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - run: cargo install shipper --locked
      - name: Publish (hard gate reads .shipper/rehearsal.json)
        env:
          CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN }}
        run: shipper publish --rehearsal-registry rehearsal
```

Key points:

- `rehearse` job runs against kellnr, produces `.shipper/rehearsal.json`.
- Artifact hands the receipt off to the `publish` job.
- `publish` job sets `--rehearsal-registry` so the hard gate activates
  and consults the downloaded `rehearsal.json`. If rehearsal passed
  and `plan_id` matches, publish proceeds. Otherwise, fail.

## Troubleshooting

### "rehearsal registry 'X' is not configured"

You passed `--rehearsal-registry X` or set `[rehearsal] registry = "X"`
but there's no matching `[[registries.registries]]` entry. Declare that entry,
then select it explicitly with
`--registries X --rehearsal-registry X`.

### "rehearsal registry is not isolated from live registry"

The configured rehearsal registry has a name collision, overlaps the live
API/index authority, belongs to the crates.io host family, or violates more
than one of those guards. Point it at a separately named non-production
registry on a distinct authority. The diagnostic contains sanitized normalized
authorities only. Rejection occurs before rehearsal state/events, registry
requests, and publish/smoke Cargo; workspace discovery may already have run
`cargo metadata`.

### "rehearsal receipt is stale: plan_id mismatch"

The workspace changed between `shipper rehearse` and `shipper publish`.
Re-run `shipper rehearse --registries NAME --rehearsal-registry NAME` on the
current workspace state.

### "no rehearsal receipt was found"

The hard gate fires when a rehearsal registry is configured but
`rehearsal.json` is missing. Either run
`shipper rehearse --registries NAME --rehearsal-registry NAME` first, or pass
`--skip-rehearsal` to bypass (not recommended).

## What rehearsal does NOT cover automatically

- **Install-smoke for every crate.** Rehearsal can run an opt-in
  `cargo install --registry rehearsal <crate>` check with
  `--smoke-install <crate>`, but it only applies to the named crate and
  that crate must expose a binary target. Library-only crates cannot be
  installed directly.
- **Consumer-workspace build.** A tiny fixture consumer crate that
  depends on the rehearsal-registry version and runs `cargo build`
  would catch `workspace-path → registry-path` resolution bugs the
  publish and install-smoke checks can still miss. This remains
  follow-on work.
