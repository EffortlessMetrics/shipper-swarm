# How to inspect a stalled or interrupted run

Use this path when a workflow is quiet, a runner was cancelled, or you need to
decide whether retained evidence supports resume. Do not infer safety from log
silence, a lock's age, or `state.json` alone.

## Triage: which surface answers which question?

| Question | Authority | Command |
|---|---|---|
| What can local durable evidence prove? | correlated events/state/receipt/lock evidence | `shipper status --durable` |
| What happened, and in what order? | `events.jsonl` | `shipper inspect-events` |
| What was the last durable event? | `events.jsonl` | `shipper inspect-events` or raw `jq` |
| Which packages are projected complete? | `state.json` projection | inspect `packages[].state.state` |
| What did a terminal run summarize? | `receipt.json` | `shipper inspect-receipt` |
| Why did ambiguity stop? | events plus `reconciliation.json` | inspect the retained paths |

Events are authoritative, state is a resumable projection, and a receipt is a
derived terminal summary. When they disagree, stop and investigate.

## 1. Start with the fail-closed durable view

```bash
shipper status --durable
```

This local mode bypasses registry access. It correlates the active event
segment with plan, workspace, state, receipt, reconciliation, and lock
identity. Its fail-closed status distinguishes `no_evidence`,
`identity_mismatch`, `evidence_disagreement`, and `unknown`: respectively no
durable run, mismatched source/plan/registry/evidence identity, contradictory
evidence, or an unfinished run whose liveness cannot be established. None of
those statuses authorizes resume.

On Linux, `Live` requires an exact local boot, PID namespace, PID, and
process-start match. `NotLive` means the matching-scope process was observed
absent; it is not by itself a safe-resume verdict. Follow the reported rerun
posture and reason.

## 2. Read the latest authoritative events

```bash
shipper inspect-events

# Raw tail when jq is available
jq -c '.' .shipper/events.jsonl | tail -20
```

A `retry_backoff_started` event records why the run waited, its attempt, and
`next_attempt_at`:

```bash
jq -c 'select(.event_type.type == "retry_backoff_started") | .event_type' \
  .shipper/events.jsonl | tail -1
```

A future timestamp explains the recorded wait; it does not independently
prove that the process is alive. Registry limits and visibility delays can
change, so prefer emitted evidence over hard-coded timing assumptions.

Find the latest package and authoritative publish outcomes with:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.event_type.type == "package_started") | .package' \
  .shipper/events.jsonl | tail -1

jq -r 'select(.event_type.type == "package_published") | .package' \
  .shipper/events.jsonl | sort -u
```

## 3. Compare the state projection

The package-state path is `packages[].state.state`, not
`packages[].status`:

```bash
jq -r '.packages[] | "\(.name)@\(.version): \(.state.state)"' \
  .shipper/state.json
```

A disagreement between this projection and `events.jsonl` is evidence drift,
not a reason to edit state or force resume.

## 4. Inspect failure and reconciliation evidence

```bash
jq -c 'select(.event_type.type == "package_failed") | .event_type' \
  .shipper/events.jsonl | tail -1

jq -c 'select(.event_type.type == "publish_reconciled") | .event_type' \
  .shipper/events.jsonl

jq '.' .shipper/reconciliation.json
```

`reconciliation.json` is conditional. When an ambiguous Cargo result becomes
`StillUnknown`, preserve it and investigate. Shipper deliberately supplies no
retry command while registry truth is inconclusive.

## 5. Decide whether resume is allowed

Run `shipper resume` only when `status --durable` reports agreeing retained
evidence and a safe rerun posture. Resume recomputes the plan, checks source,
workspace, registry, and run identity, skips terminal packages, and reconciles
ambiguous outcomes before new Cargo activity.

Do not use `--force-resume` as routine recovery. It overrides a plan guard and
requires a separate operator risk decision.

## CI interruption

Download the complete `.shipper/` artifact and restore it beside the exact
source checkout that produced it. Keep `events.jsonl`, `state.json`, optional
`reconciliation.json`, the lock record, and any terminal `receipt.json`
together. See [Run a Shipper release in GitHub Actions](run-in-github-actions.md)
for artifact handling and the
[safe recovery tutorial](../tutorials/recover-from-interruption.md) for a mock
cross-job rehearsal.
