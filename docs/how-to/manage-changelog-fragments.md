# Manage changelog fragments locally

Shipper uses Changie to capture release-note material at commit time while implementation context is still fresh. This is a **local pre-commit workflow**, not a GitHub Actions gate.

The fragment ledger helps release preparation answer three different editorial questions without treating every merged PR as equally important:

- What should lead the release notes?
- What belongs in the detailed changelog?
- What should be retained but demoted to maintenance?

## Install the tools

Install Changie v1.25.1, then install the repository-owned hook:

```bash
changie --version
cargo precommit install
cargo precommit status
```

Use a packaged or release binary that reports v1.25.1. Homebrew and Winget install the current packaged release; a manual v1.25.1 asset is available from Changie's GitHub Releases page. When Changie advances, update the repository pin and local binary together rather than silently accepting changed rendering behavior.

The hook installer is idempotent and refuses to overwrite a foreign hook. A hook is current only when its complete script matches the repository-generated dispatcher. An older Shipper-owned version is stale and repairable; a truncated or customized script carrying the current marker is conflicting and is never overwritten automatically. Running `cargo precommit install` upgrades the unmodified legacy v1 Shipper hook to the staged-source v2 dispatcher.

Remove only the unmodified current or stale Shipper-owned hook with:

```bash
cargo precommit uninstall
```

The installed dispatcher creates an owner-only temporary checkout of the staged index and runs Cargo, `.cargo/config.toml`, and `xtask` from that checkout. Git queries target the original repository through a hook-only root handoff that must resolve to that repository's exact top level. This keeps unstaged tooling edits or an unrelated ambient environment variable from changing which staged commit passes. Cleanup preserves the Cargo process exit status even when temporary-directory removal fails.

## Add a fragment

For a user-visible or compatibility-relevant change:

```bash
changie new
```

Select:

1. the Keep-a-Changelog kind;
2. the primary audience;
3. the release-note importance;
4. the optional PR number, when known;
5. a concise operator- or consumer-facing body.

Stage the generated `.changes/unreleased/*.yaml` file with the implementation.

## What the hook checks

`cargo precommit` performs only local, inexpensive checks over the staged Git index:

- staged whitespace and conflict-marker hygiene;
- whether release-note-relevant staged paths have a fragment already staged or committed on the branch;
- Changie v1.25.1 availability when Changie validation is required;
- a dry-run batch over the staged configuration and fragments.

A dry-run may allow an empty unreleased ledger only when no release-note-relevant path and no branch-local fragment are present, as after a deliberate release batch. This does not bypass fragment enforcement: a staged product change without a fragment is recorded as a failure before Changie validation runs.

The default comparison base is `origin/main`. Override it for a stacked or unusual branch:

```bash
SHIPPER_PRECOMMIT_BASE=<ref> cargo precommit
```

A run writes an advisory receipt to `target/hooks/pre-commit.json`. The receipt records staged paths, relevant paths, discovered branch fragments, whether an empty Changie batch was allowed, the observed Changie version, any exemption reason, and the local result.

## Relevant and exempt paths

The hook expects a fragment for changes to:

- production Rust under `crates/*/src/`;
- public crate manifests and READMEs;
- root release/product surfaces;
- user-facing tutorials, how-to, reference, and explanation docs;
- release workflow behavior and generated CI templates;
- the Rust toolchain floor.

It automatically exempts test directories and files, snapshots, ordinary CI workflows, policy ledgers, agent-control files, xtask internals, and internal status documents.

Inline test-only edits inside a production source file cannot be inferred safely from the path. For a genuine exception, keep the rest of the hook active and provide a substantive reason of at least 12 characters:

```bash
SHIPPER_PRECOMMIT_CHANGELOG_EXEMPT="test-only inline module" git commit
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SHIPPER_PRECOMMIT_CHANGELOG_EXEMPT = "test-only inline module"
git commit
Remove-Item Env:SHIPPER_PRECOMMIT_CHANGELOG_EXEMPT
```

State the same reason in the PR. `git commit --no-verify` remains Git's emergency bypass, but it skips all local checks rather than only the fragment requirement.

## Why this is not CI

The hook is shift-left authoring support. It is intentionally bypassable, depends on a developer-local Changie binary, and is not merge authority. GitHub continues to prove candidate-head Rust behavior, policy, security, packaging, and review independently.

No workflow should install Changie merely to repeat this gate. The lasting evidence is the reviewed fragment and the release documents produced from the fragment ledger, not a green hosted hook simulation.

## Retained pre-Changie history

The tracked changelog through **0.5.0** predates Changie. The complete 0.5.0-through-0.1.0 body is retained verbatim in `.changes/0.5.0.md`; `.changes/header.tpl.md` owns the title and `[Unreleased]` boundary.

This is an opaque historical baseline. Do not split it into reconstructed fragments, rewrite old prose during ordinary release work, or run `changie batch 0.5.0`.

Prove the retained files still reproduce the tracked changelog before and after any edit to `.changie.yaml`, `.changes/*.md`, the header template, or `CHANGELOG.md`:

```bash
cargo changelog-roundtrip
```

The command requires exactly Changie v1.25.1, runs `changie merge --dry-run`, permits only a zero-versus-one final-newline difference, and reports the first material mismatch. Pure xtask fixture tests independently protect the historical-section boundary without installing Changie in CI.

A synthetic configuration proof that does not select a real release version is:

```bash
changie batch 9999.0.0-baseline-proof \
  --dry-run \
  --allow-no-changes=true
```

## Prepare a later release

For releases after 0.5.0:

```bash
VERSION=<next-version>
cargo changelog-roundtrip
changie batch "$VERSION"
# Deliberately curate .changes/$VERSION.md.
changie merge
cargo changelog-roundtrip
```

Review every fragment before batching. Treat the generated version file as an editorial starting point, not as automatically approved release notes. Confirm that remaining unreleased fragments are intentional next-release work and that no retained historical release section was dropped or rewritten.

Changie does not select the version, authorize a tag, publish crates, or replace release readiness review. Continue with the [release operator runbook](../release-runbook.md) and a copied [release preparation checklist](../release/release-preparation-checklist.md), which record the exact swarm candidate, history-preserving promotion, release-authority rehearsal, tag identity, publish train, and post-release backfill.
