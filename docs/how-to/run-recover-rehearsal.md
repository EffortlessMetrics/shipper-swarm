# How-to: Run the Recover rehearsal

Goal: prove that Shipper's `resume` path works under a real workflow
interruption, without confusing safe runner-artifact proof with destructive
crates.io rehearsal. This is the operator side of
[#90](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/shipper/issues/90).

Synthetic coverage lives in
`crates/shipper-cli/tests/e2e_rehearse.rs`, which exercises the same
invariants (state/events/skip/idempotency) against a mock registry and
fake cargo. That test runs on every CI commit. The safe runner-artifact
workflow below is the default live-runner proof. The crates.io rehearsal is a
release-authority exercise for the rare case where a release line explicitly
needs real-registry interruption proof.

## Safe runner-artifact rehearsal

The source-level fake-Cargo/mock-registry test is available to every checkout:

```bash
cargo test -p shipper-cli --test e2e_rehearse \
  rehearsal_interrupted_publish_then_resume_preserves_invariants \
  -- --exact --nocapture
```

Maintainers with Actions write permission on `EffortlessMetrics/shipper` can
then use the dedicated cross-job workflow before attempting the crates.io
rehearsal below:

```bash
gh workflow run live-runner-interruption-rehearsal.yml \
  --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper \
  --ref main
```

This workflow does not publish to crates.io. It runs the same fake-Cargo/mock
registry fixture across two real GitHub jobs:

1. `interrupt` creates a three-crate fixture, runs `shipper publish` until the
   third crate fails, and uploads the interrupted `.shipper/` directory.
2. `resume` downloads that `.shipper/` artifact into a fresh runner, recreates
   the same workspace, runs `shipper resume`, verifies no duplicate publishes,
   and uploads the resumed `.shipper/` directory.

Download both artifacts after the run:

```bash
gh run download <run-id> \
  --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper \
  --name shipper-live-interruption-seed-<run-id> \
  --dir seed-evidence

gh run download <run-id> \
  --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper \
  --name shipper-live-interruption-resume-<run-id> \
  --dir resumed-evidence
```

The workflow passes only if:

- the interrupted artifact contains `state.json`, `events.jsonl`, and the
  fake-Cargo command log;
- the resume job consumes that artifact from a separate runner job;
- already-published crates are skipped, not republished;
- the resumed artifact contains `receipt.json`;
- `events.jsonl` has no state/event drift and records one
  `package_published` event per crate.

This is the safe proof for artifact upload/download and runner handoff. The
0.4.0 support tier cites run `26051581056` as the stable/internal live-runner
interruption proof. This safe rehearsal does not publish to crates.io and does
not prove live crates.io rate-limit or sparse-index behavior.

## Prerequisites

The remainder of this guide is a **destructive release-authority-only**
crates.io rehearsal. It creates permanent registry history even when every
version is later yanked. Do not run it from a normal pull request, documentation
review, or active-development repository. Require explicit release authority,
approved throwaway versions, credentials, and a containment plan first.

- Admin access to <https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/shipper>.
- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` with publish scope for all 13 public crates already
  configured (or Trusted Publishing registration complete — see
  [run-in-github-actions.md](run-in-github-actions.md)).
- A throwaway version suffix that has not been used. Convention:
  `v<next-version>-test-resume-<YYYYMMDD>`.

## The rehearsal

### Step 1 — prep the throwaway tag

On a clean `origin/main`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/main
git tag -a v<next-version>-test-resume-$(date +%Y%m%d) -m "recover rehearsal"
git push origin v<next-version>-test-resume-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

> **Do NOT** use a real RC version. Yanking is containment, not undo —
> a rehearsal tag pollutes crates.io if left unyanked.

### Step 2 — kick off the release workflow

Pushing the tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` →
`publish-crates-io` job automatically.

Alternatively, dispatch manually:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --ref <tag>
```

### Step 3 — watch for the mid-run kill point

```bash
gh run watch --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper
```

Once 2–3 crates have authoritative `package_published` events in the retained
event stream:

```bash
gh run cancel <run-id> --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper
```

The `shipper-state-preflight` and `shipper-state-plan` artifacts will
already be uploaded. The `shipper-state-final` artifact is uploaded
`if: always()` so the cancellation itself triggers it — wait ~30s after
cancelling for the artifact upload to complete.

### Step 4 — collect evidence

```bash
gh run download <run-id> --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper
```

Expect four directories:

- `shipper-state-plan/` — plan stage artifact
- `shipper-state-preflight/` — post-preflight artifact
- `shipper-state-final/` — the crucial one. Contains `state.json` and
  `events.jsonl` at the moment of cancellation. A terminal `receipt.json` is
  expected only after a run finalizes, not merely because it was cancelled.

### Step 5 — sanity-check the artifacts

Pull up `shipper-state-final/`:

```bash
cd shipper-state-final
# state.json parses; events.jsonl is valid NDJSON
jq '.' state.json
jq -c '.' events.jsonl | head
# Run this only when the artifact actually contains a terminal receipt:
jq '.' receipt.json
```

This downloaded directory contains retained `.shipper/` evidence, not the
matching source workspace. Do not run `status --durable` here: it recomputes
the release plan. Restore the artifact as `.shipper/` inside the exact source
checkout and use the matching candidate binary before asking Shipper for a
durable classification.

Expected shape:

- `state.json` has `state_version: "shipper.state.v1"` and a non-empty
  `plan_id`.
- Some packages have `state: "published"`; at least one is still
  `state: "pending"` (or `"uploaded"` / `"failed"`).
- `events.jsonl` ends with a complete line (no half-written event).
- `package_published` event count equals the count of `published`
  packages in state.json — events-as-truth.

### Step 6 — trigger the resume

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml \
  --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper \
  --ref <same-tag> \
  --field mode=resume \
  --field artifact_run_id=<run-id-from-step-3>
```

### Step 7 — verify the resume

The resume run should:

- Download `shipper-state-final` from the cancelled run into `.shipper/`.
- Validate `plan_id` matches current workspace plan_id (it should, same
  tag).
- Log `already published (skipping)` for each crate that was Published
  in the downloaded state.
- Run `cargo publish` **only** for the remaining packages.
- Produce a final `shipper-state-final` artifact with all 13 public packages
  showing `state: "published"`.

Download the resume's artifact and spot-check:

```bash
gh run download <resume-run-id> --repo EffortlessMetrics/shipper
jq '.packages | to_entries | map({name: .key, state: .value.state.state})' \
    shipper-state-resume-*/state.json
```

Every entry should be `{"state": "published"}`.

### Step 8 — spot-check crates.io

```bash
for c in shipper shipper-cli shipper-core shipper-config shipper-types \
         shipper-duration shipper-retry shipper-encrypt shipper-webhook \
         shipper-registry shipper-sparse-index shipper-cargo-failure \
         shipper-output-sanitizer; do
  echo "- $c:"
  cargo search --limit 1 "$c" | head -1
done
```

Each line should show the rehearsal version.

### Step 9 — plan, review, and yank the rehearsal

```bash
shipper plan-yank \
  --from-receipt <downloaded-resume-receipt.json> \
  --format json > yank-plan.raw.json

# Default receipt mode does not yet apply --reason; stamp the approved reason
# into every final entry before review and execution.
jq --arg reason "authorized rehearsal containment" \
  '.entries |= map(.reason = $reason)' \
  yank-plan.raw.json > yank-plan.json

# Review every package, version, registry, reason, and dependents-first order.
jq '.' yank-plan.json

# Destructive: execute only after the reviewed plan is approved.
shipper yank --plan yank-plan.json
```

Yanking is containment, not deletion — the bytes remain on crates.io,
but new resolves skip them.

The reviewed final plan embeds the approved reason into each entry. Plan
execution keeps that evidence and replaces the direct, unreviewed `cargo yank`
loop. [Issue #338](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm/issues/338)
tracks applying `plan-yank --reason` directly in default receipt mode.

## Pass / fail rubric

The rehearsal passes iff **all** of the following are true:

- [ ] `shipper-state-final` artifact exists after the cancelled run.
- [ ] `state.json` parses; `plan_id` non-empty.
- [ ] `events.jsonl` is valid NDJSON (every line parses).
- [ ] `package_published` event count = published-package count in
      state.json (events-as-truth).
- [ ] Resume does not re-`cargo publish` any crate that was already
      Published (check logs for duplicate `Publishing X@...` lines).
- [ ] Final state has every package Published.
- [ ] All crates visible on crates.io from a fresh resolver.

Any `[ ]` → file a bug citing the specific artifact. Don't ship the
release line the rehearsal was cut from until the regression is fixed
**and** the rehearsal has been re-run green.

## When to re-run

- Before a release line that explicitly requires real crates.io interruption
  proof. Prefer the safe runner-artifact rehearsal unless release policy calls
  for destructive real-registry proof.
- After any change to `crates/shipper-core/src/engine/`,
  `crates/shipper-core/src/state/`, or `crates/shipper-core/src/runtime/`
  that touches persistence, resumption, or reconciliation.
- Whenever `.github/workflows/release.yml` changes the dispatch /
  resume shape.

The synthetic test at `crates/shipper-cli/tests/e2e_rehearse.rs` runs
on every CI commit and acts as a cheap pre-flight, but it's not a
substitute for this procedure. The safe rehearsal proves a real runner
handoff with fake Cargo and a mock registry; the destructive crates.io
path is the only rehearsal here that touches a real registry.
