# Shipper Swarm Sync

Status: active

`EffortlessMetrics/shipper` remains the release authority for Shipper:
crates.io publishing, release evidence, tags, GitHub Releases, release
workflow credentials, and signing credentials stay here until release authority
is deliberately moved.

Routine development happens in
[`EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm`](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm).

## Repository Roles

| Repository | Role | Normal merge method |
|---|---|---|
| `EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm` | Active development | Squash merge PRs |
| `EffortlessMetrics/shipper` | Release authority and provenance | Merge commits |

## What Belongs Here

Use `EffortlessMetrics/shipper` for:

- swarm sync PRs
- release-authority docs
- crates.io and GitHub Release workflow changes
- release evidence and readiness proof updates
- signing, provenance, or Trusted Publishing changes
- emergency hotfixes, when explicitly declared

Use `EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm` for routine feature work, refactors,
tests, Changie fragments, changelog preparation, and normal development PRs.

## Sync Policy

Syncs from `shipper-swarm/main` back to `shipper/main` preserve swarm commit
history. Do not squash or rebase sync PRs.

Create sync branches from `shipper/main` and merge `shipper-swarm/main` with
a merge commit:

```bash
git remote add swarm git@github.com:EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm.git
git fetch origin --prune --tags
git fetch swarm --prune

git switch -c sync/shipper-swarm-YYYY-MM-DD origin/main
git merge --no-ff swarm/main -m "merge: sync shipper-swarm development"
git push -u origin sync/shipper-swarm-YYYY-MM-DD
```

Open the PR in `EffortlessMetrics/shipper` and merge it with a merge commit.
Do not use squash merge or rebase merge.

## Release-Candidate Promotion Contract

For a release promotion, first freeze and prove an exact merged
`shipper-swarm/main` candidate. Record its commit and tree in a copied
[`release-preparation-checklist.md`](../release/release-preparation-checklist.md).
Normal swarm merges pause at that point.

Before pushing the sync branch, prove:

```bash
test "$(git rev-parse swarm/main)" = "$SWARM_SHA"
test "$(git rev-parse \"$SWARM_SHA^{tree}\")" = "$SWARM_TREE"
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main "$SWARM_SHA"

test "$(git rev-parse HEAD^{tree})" = \
  "$SWARM_TREE"
```

The first command proves release-authority main is an ancestor of the frozen
swarm candidate. The second proves the non-fast-forward promotion merge did not
change the candidate tree.

A conflict, manual content edit, or tree mismatch is not an acceptable
promotion repair. Stop, reconcile release-authority changes back into swarm,
freeze and prove a new swarm candidate, and promote again.

The release record must distinguish:

- frozen swarm SHA and tree;
- promotion merge SHA and tree;
- approved release-authority SHA and tree after any separately reviewed
  release-only change;
- tag SHA;
- rehearsal, binary, publish, resume, and final artifact identities.

A promotion merge is not publication authorization. Continue with the
[release operator runbook](../release-runbook.md), rerun the full gate in
`EffortlessMetrics/shipper`, and tag only when the checklist is complete on the
exact approved release-authority SHA.

## Backfill After Promotion and Release

After a swarm-sync PR lands, fast-forward `shipper-swarm/main` to the new
`shipper/main` merge commit before continuing normal swarm development:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune --tags
git fetch swarm --prune

git merge-base --is-ancestor swarm/main origin/main
git push swarm origin/main:main
```

This backfill should include any final release-authority-only commits that are
part of the approved source history. Record the final source SHA in the release
checklist.

If the merge-base check fails, stop the fast-forward path and use the
source-backfill path below. Do not force push, squash, or rebase the sync
commit.

If the source repo receives a release-authority PR that was not a swarm sync
while `shipper-swarm` already has unsynced development commits, do not
fast-forward swarm to source. Open a source-backfill PR in `shipper-swarm` that
merges `shipper/main` into `shipper-swarm/main`, and merge that backfill with a
merge commit. This preserves both the source merge commit and the swarm
development commits.

## Credential Boundary

Do not move these into `shipper-swarm` without a separate release-authority
migration plan:

- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
- crates.io publish tokens
- release signing secrets
- GitHub Release publish credentials
- Trusted Publishing release authority
