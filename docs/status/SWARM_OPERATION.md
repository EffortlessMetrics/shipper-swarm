# Shipper Swarm Operation

Status: active

`EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm` is the active development repository.
`EffortlessMetrics/shipper` remains the release authority for crates.io
publishing, release evidence, tags, and signing credentials until that
authority is explicitly moved.

## Repository Roles

| Repository | Role | Normal merge method |
|---|---|---|
| `EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm` | Active development | Squash merge PRs |
| `EffortlessMetrics/shipper` | Release authority and provenance | Merge commits |

## History Model

`shipper-swarm/main` must remain a continuation of `shipper/main` history:

```text
shipper/main:
A---B---C---D

shipper-swarm/main:
A---B---C---D---S1---S2---S3
```

It must not be seeded as an orphan snapshot. Snapshot seeding copies the tree
but loses ancestry, which breaks ahead/behind comparisons and makes later
promotion back to `shipper` ambiguous.

The expected steady-state ancestry check is:

```bash
git merge-base --is-ancestor public/main origin/main
git rev-list --left-right --count public/main...origin/main
```

The healthy count before a source sync, and again after source sync backfill,
is:

```text
0 N
```

where `N` is the number of swarm-only commits not yet synced back to
`shipper`.

Immediately after a true swarm-sync PR lands in `shipper`, `shipper/main`
contains a merge commit that may not yet exist in `shipper-swarm/main`. During
that short window the count can be `1 0`. Fast-forward `shipper-swarm/main` to
`shipper/main` before reopening normal swarm development.

If a release-authority PR lands directly in `shipper` while `shipper-swarm` is
already ahead, do not fast-forward swarm to source because that would discard
swarm development commits. Merge `shipper/main` back into `shipper-swarm/main`
with the source-backfill process below.

## Merge Policy

PRs into `shipper-swarm/main` are squash-merged. That keeps normal development
to one reviewed commit per PR.

Syncs from `shipper-swarm/main` back to `shipper/main` are never squashed or
rebased. Use a merge commit so the release authority preserves the sequence of
swarm-delivered commits:

```bash
git remote add swarm git@github.com:EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm.git
git fetch origin --prune --tags
git fetch swarm --prune

git switch -c sync/shipper-swarm-YYYY-MM-DD origin/main
git merge --no-ff swarm/main -m "merge: sync shipper-swarm development"
git push -u origin sync/shipper-swarm-YYYY-MM-DD
```

Open the sync PR in `EffortlessMetrics/shipper` and merge it with a merge
commit.

After a swarm-sync PR lands, backfill the release-authority merge commit into
`shipper-swarm` with a fast-forward update from the `shipper` checkout:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune --tags
git fetch swarm --prune

git merge-base --is-ancestor swarm/main origin/main
git push swarm origin/main:main
```

This update is not a normal swarm development PR. It preserves the source
merge commit so the next swarm development commit again starts from
`shipper/main` ancestry. Keep normal swarm PR merges paused until the ancestry
check returns `0 N` again. If the merge-base command fails, use the
source-backfill path instead; do not force push or squash the sync commit.

## Source-Backfill Exception

Release-authority PRs may land directly in `shipper` for release evidence,
credentials, signing, or repository policy. When that happens while
`shipper-swarm` has unsynced development commits, backfill the source commit
into swarm with a merge commit:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
git fetch public --prune --tags

git switch -c backfill/shipper-source-YYYY-MM-DD origin/main
git merge --no-ff public/main -m "merge: backfill shipper release-authority changes"
git push -u origin backfill/shipper-source-YYYY-MM-DD
```

Open the backfill PR in `EffortlessMetrics/shipper-swarm`. This is not a normal
development PR: merge it with a merge commit so `shipper/main` becomes an
ancestor of `shipper-swarm/main` again. Temporarily allowing merge commits for
that PR is acceptable; restore squash-only settings immediately afterward.

## Queue Stewardship

Treat every open `shipper-swarm` PR as part of the active development queue:
inspect the intended slice, read CI and review output, fix real findings,
validate honestly, squash-merge when clean, and delete the branch when safe.
Keep overlapping work closed or explicitly deferred before opening another PR
for the same surface.

Dependabot maintenance belongs in `shipper-swarm` first. If the same dependency
bump opens in `EffortlessMetrics/shipper`, close the source-repo PR as duplicate
maintenance work and let the accepted swarm commit flow back through the normal
non-squash source sync.

Dependabot and other bot-authored PRs intentionally skip the secret-bearing
automatic Droid review workflow. The required Rust gate still evaluates bot
diffs through its explicit GitHub-hosted fallback. When an LLM review is useful,
use the maintainer refresh procedure in
[`docs/ci/test-evidence-lanes.md`](../ci/test-evidence-lanes.md) and
[`docs/how-to/shipper-swarm-migration-runbook.md`](../how-to/shipper-swarm-migration-runbook.md):
inspect the diff, run focused validation, push a maintainer-authored refresh or
trusted same-repo branch, and require the normal `Shipper Rust Small Result`
before merge.

## CI and Branch Protection

`shipper-swarm/main` requires only the normalized result check:

```text
Shipper Rust Small Result
```

Do not require route-specific implementation jobs directly. Only one of those
jobs is expected to run on each attempt.

Current routed Rust-small proof:

- Branch protection requires only `Shipper Rust Small Result`; do not require
  route-specific implementation jobs because exactly one route should run per
  attempt.
- Current same-repo `CPX42` routing proof passed on PR #117 with
  `Routed Rust Small` run `26413038913`; the `CPX42` implementation job and
  normalized `Shipper Rust Small Result` both succeeded.
- Forced route proof before the 100% self-hosted sweep passed for `CX43` with
  `workflow_dispatch` run `26355258014` and for `CX53` with
  `workflow_dispatch` run `26356173639`.
- Current self-hosted fallback proof passed on post-merge `main` run
  `26413498807`; `Shipper Rust Tiny Fallback (routed to self-hosted)` and the
  normalized `Shipper Rust Small Result` both succeeded.
- Current `shipper-swarm` policy routes all workflow jobs, including the tiny
  fallback lane, to self-hosted runners. Do not sync that policy to
  `EffortlessMetrics/shipper` until the release-authority runner and
  credential boundaries are explicitly decided.

## Credential Boundary

Do not add these to `shipper-swarm`:

- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
- crates.io publish tokens
- release signing secrets
- GitHub Release publish credentials

Release credentials stay in `EffortlessMetrics/shipper` until release
authority is deliberately migrated.

The release workflow may exist in `shipper-swarm` because the two repositories
share history and sync commits. Any release-authority workflow job that can
publish crates, mint release tokens, create GitHub Releases, or upload release
artifacts must be guarded with:

```text
github.repository == 'EffortlessMetrics/shipper'
```

That guard keeps tag and manual workflow runs inert in `shipper-swarm` while
preserving the same workflow file for merge-commit syncs back to the release
authority repository.
