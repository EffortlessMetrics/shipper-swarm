## End State

Shipper release auth is visible, bounded, and evidence-backed:

- Doctor tells operators which Trusted Publishing prerequisites are visible and
  which remain externally unproven.
- Preflight, publish, resume, events, and receipts expose whether the release
  used Trusted Publishing, token fallback, or an unknown/auth-missing path.
- Long-lived token fallback remains available for bootstrap and incident
  response, but is never hidden.
- Support tiers distinguish advisory diagnostics from a proven Trusted
  Publishing default.
- No auth evidence stores token values.

Existing foundations, including Doctor JSON diagnostics, preflight OIDC
warnings, release workflow OIDC wiring, and token sanitizer coverage, are
treated as already landed baseline.

## PR Sequence

### PR 1 - Source-of-truth activation

Linked spec: docs/specs/SHIPPER-SPEC-0006-release-auth-evidence-and-trusted-publishing.md
Blocks: PR 2
Blocked by:

#### Goal

Define the behavior contract, implementation plan, active goal, and
support-tier guardrails for release auth evidence and Trusted Publishing.

#### Production Delta

No product runtime behavior change.

#### Non-Goals

Runtime behavior, release workflow changes, support-tier promotion, crates.io
publishing, release tagging, receipt signing, and SBOM generation.

#### Acceptance

- Spec and plan exist and link to each other.
- `.shipper-meta/goals/active.toml` points to release auth evidence as the
  current lane.
- Support tiers remain advisory/planned and do not claim Trusted Publishing is
  the default.

#### Proof Commands

- `python -c "import pathlib,tomllib; tomllib.loads(pathlib.Path('.shipper-meta/goals/active.toml').read_text()); print('active goal TOML parses')"`
- `cargo xtask check-doc-contracts --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask check-file-policy --mode blocking-allowlist`
- `cargo xtask policy-report`
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

#### Rollback

Revert this spec, plan, active goal, and support-tier references if the auth
lane is superseded before runtime work depends on it.

### PR 2 - Auth mode evidence

Linked spec: docs/specs/SHIPPER-SPEC-0006-release-auth-evidence-and-trusted-publishing.md
Blocks: PR 3
Blocked by: PR 1

#### Goal

Record auth mode and token fallback presence in release evidence without
exposing token values.

#### Production Delta

Preflight, publish/resume evidence, events, or receipts only, depending on the
smallest existing data path that can truthfully carry the fact.

#### Non-Goals

Trusted Publishing default promotion, crates.io-side registration proof,
release workflow rewrites, and receipt signing.

#### Acceptance

- Evidence distinguishes Trusted Publishing context, Cargo token auth, Cargo
  token auth with OIDC context, missing auth, and unknown auth paths.
- Token fallback remains visible when workflow metadata or Doctor-visible
  workflow configuration proves it; token-plus-OIDC runtime evidence must not
  overclaim token provenance by itself.
- Token values never appear in human output, JSON output, events, receipts, or
  snapshots.
- Unknown crates.io-side registration remains explicit.

#### Proof Commands

- `cargo test -p shipper-core run_preflight_warns_when_token_auth_overrides_oidc --lib --locked`
- `cargo test -p shipper-core collect_auth_evidence --lib --locked`
- `cargo test -p shipper-core run_publish_receipt_contains_evidence_after_success --lib --locked`
- `cargo test -p shipper-output-sanitizer --locked`
- focused receipt/event tests for auth-mode evidence
- `cargo xtask policy-report`
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

#### Rollback

Remove auth-mode evidence fields if they overclaim or leak sensitive values.

### PR 3 - Trusted Publishing proof artifact

Linked spec: docs/specs/SHIPPER-SPEC-0006-release-auth-evidence-and-trusted-publishing.md
Blocks: PR 4
Blocked by: PR 2

#### Goal

Produce a workflow or release-readiness artifact that proves whether the
Trusted Publishing token mint path works for Shipper's release environment and
whether fallback was used.

#### Production Delta

Release workflow/rehearsal evidence only. The release workflow writes
`.shipper/auth-evidence.json` after each Trusted Publishing token mint step and
before the following `.shipper/` artifact upload.

#### Non-Goals

Publishing crates unless this runs as part of an approved release proof,
removing fallback, or claiming crates.io-side registration for crates that were
not rehearsed.

#### Acceptance

- Artifact records whether `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action@v1` succeeded.
- Artifact records whether token fallback was used.
- Artifact names the workflow, run ID, commit, and environment.
- Failed Trusted Publishing registration remains an actionable setup gap, not a
  generic auth failure.
- Artifact limits state that token values are omitted and crates.io-side
  trusted-publisher registration is externally unproven unless separately
  rehearsed.
- Final 0.4.0 Release workflow run `26141754574` uploaded
  `shipper-state-final` with `.shipper/auth-evidence.json`; the artifact
  records token mint failure, fallback configured, fallback used,
  `selected_token_source = "fallback_secret"`, and no token values.

#### Proof Commands

- release auth rehearsal or release-readiness workflow artifact
- `cargo xtask check-workflow-surfaces --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask check-process-policy --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask check-network-policy --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask policy-report`
- `git diff --check`

#### Rollback

Demote any Trusted Publishing claim if the artifact is missing or proves only
fallback behavior.

#### Result

Complete. Release workflow proof exists and proves fallback behavior for the
0.4.0 release environment. It intentionally does not promote Trusted Publishing
as the default, because the final release evidence selected `fallback_secret`
rather than a short-lived Trusted Publishing token.

### PR 4 - Support-tier promotion

Linked spec: docs/specs/SHIPPER-SPEC-0006-release-auth-evidence-and-trusted-publishing.md
Blocks:
Blocked by: PR 3

#### Goal

Promote only claims proven by auth-mode evidence and workflow artifacts.

#### Production Delta

Documentation/status only.

#### Non-Goals

Runtime changes and release workflow changes.

#### Acceptance

- Support tiers name exact proof commands and artifacts.
- Trusted Publishing default remains planned/advisory unless short-lived-token
  use is proven as the normal path.
- README and product claims do not exceed proven evidence.

#### Result

Complete for the bounded proof-artifact claim. Support tiers now name the
workflow artifact proof and keep the stronger Trusted Publishing default claim
planned/advisory.

#### Proof Commands

- `cargo xtask check-doc-contracts --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask policy-report`
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

#### Rollback

Demote any claim whose proof artifact is missing or weak.

### PR 5 - Trusted Publishing default proof activation

Linked spec: docs/specs/SHIPPER-SPEC-0006-release-auth-evidence-and-trusted-publishing.md
Blocks: PR 6
Blocked by: PR 4

#### Goal

Move the active goal from completed idempotent publish proof to the remaining
Trusted Publishing default proof gap, and archive the completed goal.

#### Production Delta

No product runtime behavior change.

#### Non-Goals

Trusted Publishing promotion, crates.io-side registration changes, release
publication, release tagging, and workflow credential changes.

#### Acceptance

- `.shipper-meta/goals/active.toml` points to this accepted spec and plan.
- The completed idempotent workspace publish goal is archived under
  `.shipper-meta/goals/archive/`.
- Support tiers continue to say that Trusted Publishing default is
  planned/advisory until short-lived-token proof exists.
- The plan distinguishes the existing fallback proof artifact from the future
  default proof artifact.

#### Result

Complete in #360. The active goal now points to this release-auth spec and plan,
the idempotent workspace publish goal is archived, and Trusted Publishing
default remains planned/advisory until short-lived-token proof exists.

#### Proof Commands

- `python -c "import pathlib,tomllib; tomllib.loads(pathlib.Path('.shipper-meta/goals/active.toml').read_text()); print('active goal TOML parses')"`
- `cargo xtask check-doc-contracts --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask check-file-policy --mode blocking-allowlist`
- `cargo xtask policy-report`
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

#### Rollback

Restore the completed idempotent active goal if the Trusted Publishing default
proof lane is deferred before follow-up work depends on it.

### PR 6 - Trusted Publishing default proof artifact

Linked spec: docs/specs/SHIPPER-SPEC-0006-release-auth-evidence-and-trusted-publishing.md
Blocks: PR 7
Blocked by: PR 5 and external crates.io trusted-publisher registration

#### Goal

Produce release evidence proving whether the short-lived-token path is the
normal release auth path and whether fallback remained unused.

#### Production Delta

Release rehearsal or release-readiness evidence only.

#### Non-Goals

Removing fallback, publishing without explicit release approval, hiding fallback
configuration, or claiming crates.io registration from repo files alone.

#### Acceptance

- The evidence artifact records `selected_token_source = "trusted_publishing"`
  for the rehearsed release path, or records the exact external blocker.
- Fallback configured/used state is explicit.
- The artifact names workflow, run ID, commit, environment, and limits.
- Token values are omitted.
- Any crates.io-side registration gap remains explicit.

#### Current Blocker

Blocked on external crates.io trusted-publisher registration evidence. The
latest recorded release auth proof is final 0.4.0 Release workflow run
`26141754574`, which uploaded `.shipper/auth-evidence.json` with
`selected_token_source = "fallback_secret"`, fallback configured and used,
`auth_action.outcome = "failure"`, and token values omitted.

#### Proof Commands

- release auth rehearsal or release-readiness workflow artifact
- `cargo xtask check-workflow-surfaces --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask check-process-policy --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask check-network-policy --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask policy-report`
- `git diff --check`

#### Rollback

Demote or leave unpromoted the Trusted Publishing default claim if the artifact
proves fallback, missing registration, or any unknown auth path.

### PR 7 - Trusted Publishing default support-tier promotion

Linked spec: docs/specs/SHIPPER-SPEC-0006-release-auth-evidence-and-trusted-publishing.md
Blocks:
Blocked by: PR 6

#### Goal

Promote the Trusted Publishing default claim only if the release evidence proves
the short-lived-token path.

#### Production Delta

Documentation/status only.

#### Non-Goals

Runtime changes, workflow changes, release publication, or release tagging.

#### Acceptance

- `docs/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md` names the exact proof artifact and commands.
- The promoted claim remains limited to the rehearsed/proven release path.
- Token fallback remains documented as explicit incident-response behavior if
  it remains configured.

#### Proof Commands

- `cargo xtask check-doc-contracts --mode advisory`
- `cargo xtask policy-report`
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

#### Rollback

Demote the claim if the proof artifact is missing, weak, or proves fallback.
